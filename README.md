# Match Memory Game

This project is a memory game built using randomized prompts and the Stable Diffusion txt2img API. It generates pairs of images from randomized prompts and uses them to create a fun and engaging memory game.

## How It Works

The application starts by generating randomized prompts. These prompts are selected from various categories, providing a wide range of potential prompts for variuos and unique images. Each prompt is then used to generate an image using the Stable Diffusion txt2img API.

Once the images are generated, they are saved locally. These images are then used to create pairs for the memory game. Each pair consists of two identical images, corresponding to the same prompt.
